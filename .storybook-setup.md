        - don't forget babel file
        - creating tests
            - Footer.vue didn't have a script and I kept getting an error (see image)
    - Back to Storyshots
        - after a lot of searching I found this: create file in tests folder https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/examples/official-storybook/tests
        - still had to install storybook/react, odd
        - found this and the package.json file helped: https://github.com/vire/jest-vue-preprocessor/issues/47
        - I can get Jest working on it's own, but not through storybook :-/
