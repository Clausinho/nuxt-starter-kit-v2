- install
- setup
- struggle with actions
- get scss supported
- install storyshots
    - https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/addons/storyshots
    - npm install --save-dev react-test-renderer jest
- setup storyshots
    - Rabbit hole just to get jest working
        - https://github.com/brantwills/nuxt-ts-jest-starter-template/blob/master/template/test/unit/jest.conf.js
        - don't forget babel file
        - creating tests
            - Footer.vue didn't have a script and I kept getting an error (see image)
    - Back to Storyshots
        - after a lot of searching I found this: create file in tests folder https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/tree/master/examples/official-storybook/tests
        - still had to install storybook/react, odd
        - found this and the package.json file helped: https://github.com/vire/jest-vue-preprocessor/issues/47
        - I can get Jest working on it's own, but not through storybook :-/
        - had to do a fresh start because I got lost, kept thinking that I was using react, back tracked to last safe commit
        - figured out it was the webconfig I had in .storybook folder that was causing the problem
        - put humpty dumpty back together again
        - still getting the 'storyshots is intended only to be used with storybook' error
            - Turns out storyshots aren't [unavailable until 3.4.0-alpha.5](https://github.com/storybooks/storybook/issues/2797)
        - So I made a new branch (storyshot-alpha) and update @storybook-vue to be 3.4.0-alpha.5
        - Had to install @storybook/addon to get the action logger working (maybe it's new to 3.4.0?)
        - Ran `npm test` and got:
            ```
                ({"Object.<anonymous>":function(module,exports,require,__dirname,__filename,global,jest){<template>
